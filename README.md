This repository contains *Computer Vision Nanodegree Program* Projects for Udacity.

The Nanodegree description is available in Udacity website [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

There are 3 main projects in total
1. Facial Keypoint Detection
   * Use image processing techniques and deep learning to recognize faces and facial keypoints, such as the location of the eyes and mouth on a face.
2. Automatic Image Captioning
   * Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.
3. Landmark Detection & Tracking
   * Use sensor data to localize a robot and build a map of the environment with SLAM.
